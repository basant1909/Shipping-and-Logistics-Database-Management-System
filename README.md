In this project, we have designed a database management
system to store the logistics and data about the packaged
items that a shipment company will ship around the world.
The data can be used by both the shipment company and
the users seamlessly to gather required information.

This database will contain the senders and receivers details
once he/she plans on sending an item to be shipped such as
name, email, address, etc. This will be helpful in case of an
item being returned back to the sender. We also store the
dimensions of the package which will help us in
determining the cost of the shipment considering other
factors like mode of shipment.

This management system proves useful as we have assigned
unique IDs to every relation such as OrderID, BillingID, etc.
The sender can feel more connected to the package as he
will have access to live tracking of the package. With the
relationships present in this database management system,
we can gather essential data required quickly and also
update data wherever necessary. In the end, billing is taken
care of as we care for every user who plans on using this
database.
